Stable.  CMOS battery replaced and seems to hold charge.  CMOS values held.  Voltage on IC5 stable and correct.  Hoorah.

To fix:
- Floppy light constantly on and always reports drive empty.  Have I knackered the cable or drive?
	- there's a bodge wire on the bottom of the board going to the fdd connector.  Looked damaged.  Maybe that.
- Needs a good clean, in general.
- Missing screw under PSU: affixed with masking tape inside top of case.
- Missing one port screw thing

Possible upgrades:
- 4MB RAM?
- Ethernet/Access+?  Or HDD?  The former seems more useful (boot from a share)
